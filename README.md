How to run proxy

1. Run the command `python3 proxy.py [port number] [image_flag] [attack_flag]`.

2. [port number] refers to the port the proxy is listening on. [image_flag] refers to the value 0 or 1 indicating whether or not to substitute the image with a sub image. [attack_flag] refers to the value 0 or 1 indicating whether or not to send an attack image instead.

3. Some log statements will be printed out when the proxy is running, such as the port it is listening to and the telemetry data at the end.
